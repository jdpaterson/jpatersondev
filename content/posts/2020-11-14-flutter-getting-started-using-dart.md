Getting started with Flutter

Built on the Dart programming language

Has a C-style syntax + async/await functionality, weakly typed, single-class inheritance

Used to think async/await was just a JS es2017 thing, I was wrong! 

Easy to create an app, VSCode, install the extensions, run flutter doctor. VS Code extension has an emulator built-in!
