# (Token) Hello, World!

Alright here we are! It is post #1 of this blog and the subject is... building a blog! I'm going to split this up into 2-3 posts for the sake of brevity. So probably a post for Gatsby, a post for Netlify, and maybe another for... I dunno, domain hosting or DNS or something. For *this* article we will take a brief look at Gatsby: What is it? Why use it? And how it was used to build this blog.
